### Hi I am Daniel Beeke ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from a little city near Vienna, Austria. I like RDF and TypeScript. I have made some Open Source libraries and I am actively trying to do more open source in the RDF space. If you like RDF and are missing open source libraries, please contact me. I am actively persuing work in this space. You can also sponsor me on a more general basis.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SHACL translation to TypeScript types and SPARQL queries
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RDF things, paper popup books, woodworking  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on funding for RDF based open source liberaries
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Deno, TypeScript, JavaScript, Linux
